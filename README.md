# Wiremock Examples

Here, the idea is to show how to use Wiremock and WiremockStudio with Docker compose.

Important: you can run only one docker compose, because wiremock studio has both wiremock server and studio interface if you run both, docker will send you a port binded error!

### How to run wiremock
```
docker compose up
```

### How to run wiremock studio
```
docker compose -f ./docker-compose-studio.yml up
```
